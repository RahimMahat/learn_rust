Error handling is the process of dealing with potential errors from operations that can go wrong.
Recoverable errors are errors that we can define code to handle.
Unrecoverable errors are errors that cause the program to be unable to proceed.
The backtrace is the list of files and functions that were running at the point that the error occurred.
