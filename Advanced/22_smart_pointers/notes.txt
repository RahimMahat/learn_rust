Pointers:
  * A variable is a name for a piece of data.
  * The Rust book defines a pointer as "a variable that contains an address in memory".
  * By storing an address, a pointer variable indirectly points to a piece of data.
  * A pointer prevents the duplication of the original piece of data. Instead, we store the data's address.

References:
  * A reference is a type/category of pointer that points to valid data.
  * Create a reference with the borrow operator (&).
  * Rust's borrow checker guarantees that references point to valid/allocated data. Pointers in other languages do make the same promise.

Raw Pointers:
  * A raw pointer is a variable that stores a memory address without any safety checks.
  * A raw pointer may point to valid data but it can also point to deallocated memory.
  * Raw pointers are common in languages like C and C++. Developers still call them "references" even though they lack the safety guarantees of Rust's references.
  * Rust supports raw pointers too but references are safer and recommended.

Smart Pointers:
  * A smart pointer is a type that behaves like a pointer.
  * A smart pointer can store additional information and perform more actions compared to a plain pointer/reference.
  * Most smart pointers are built with structs. Structs grant the capacity to store more data.
  * A pointer/reference in Rust is like an address to a house.
  * A smart pointer is like an address to a house with additional information -- such as property tax records or nearby restaurants.
  * References like &T borrow data, and they are not responsible for deallocating the data; the original owner is responsible for deallocation.
  * Smart pointers often own and manage their own data, typically on the heap.
  * The advantage is that smart pointers behave like pointers but can be treated like owned types.
