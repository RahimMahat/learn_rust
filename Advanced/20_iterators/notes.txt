To iterate means to perform repeatedly. Iteration is repeating the same operation on a sequence of items, one item at a time.

The iter method will create an iterator that yields immutable references to the collection's elements.

The iter_mut method will create an iterator that yields mutable references to the collection's elements.

An adapter method is one that transforms an iterator into another iterator based on some logic.
The map method applies a closure to each item in an iterator to arrive at a new iterator of values.
The collect method exhuasts the iterator and gathers the resulting values in a new collection type.
