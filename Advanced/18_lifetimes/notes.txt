Generic Lifetimes vs Concrete Lifetimes:
  * A concrete lifetime is the region of code that a value exists in the program (the time it lives in it's memory address)
  * A generic lifetime is more abstract. It is a hypothetical lifetime, a non-specific lifetime, a future lifetime that can vary.
  * We can annotate generic lifetimes in our code. This enables functions that are flexible enough to handle varying lifetimes.

Lifetime Annotations:
  * A lifetime annotation is a name or label for a lifetime.
  * Lifetime annotations don't change the reference's lifetime. They don't affect the logic in any way.
  * A lifetime annotation is a piece of metadata that we provide to the borrow checker so that it can validate that references are valid.
